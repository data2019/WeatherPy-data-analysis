# Weatherpy-data-analysis

Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create 
a representative model of weather across world cities.

Build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
